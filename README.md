**Importing Libraries and Variables**
===============

The program starts by importing several namespaces:
* `System.Text` for working with text strings
* `OtpNet` for TOTP-related functions
* `Net.Codecrete.QrCodeGenerator` for generating QR codes

The program defines several variables:
* `key`: a random key generated using the `KeyGeneration.GenerateRandomKey(20)` function
* `base32String` and `base32Bytes`: convert the key to a Base32 string and bytes, respectively
* `HASH_ALG`, `ROTATION_TIME`, and `TOKEN_CODE_LENGHT`: constants for TOTP hash mode, rotation time, and token code length

**TOTP Generation**
=============

The program creates a new instance of the `Totp` class, passing in the following parameters:
* `secretKey`: the Base32-encoded key
* `mode`: the TOTP hash mode (SHA-512)
* `step`: the rotation time (30 seconds)
* `totpSize`: the token code length (6 digits)
* `timeCorrection`: null

This creates a TOTP object that can generate one-time passwords.

**QR Code Generation**
=====================

The program uses the `OtpUri` class to create a QR code for the TOTP authentication:
* `schema`: OTP type (TOTP)
* `secret`: the Base32-encoded key
* `user`: "user test"
* `issuer`: "Tecnosor"
* `algorithm`: SHA-512 hash mode
* `digits`: 6-digit token code length
* `period`: 30-second rotation time

The program then uses the `QrCode` class to encode the TOTP URI as a QR code and convert it to an SVG string. The resulting string is written to a file named "test.svg" using UTF-8 encoding.

**TOTP Verification**
=====================

The program prompts the user to enter their TOTP code generated by an authenticator app:
```
Console.WriteLine("Write here your TOPT code generated by authenticator app:");
string code = Console.ReadLine() ?? "";
```

It then uses the `Totp.VerifyTotp()` method to verify the entered code. If the code is correct, it prints a success message with the window (i.e., the number of seconds since the start of the authentication period).

**Predicting Future Codes**
=====================

The program enters an infinite loop where it predicts future TOTP codes using the `Totp.ComputeTotp()` method, which takes the current UTC time as input. It then prints the predicted code and waits for 30 seconds (the rotation time) before generating the next code.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to implement the TOTP algorithm in C# and generate QR codes for authentication purposes.
